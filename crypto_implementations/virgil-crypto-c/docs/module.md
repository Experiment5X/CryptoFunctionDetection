any specific limits unless otherwise specified.  The same tag may occur
at different levels with different meanings, and in such cases will be
detailed more than once here.

logical components within one physical component. Physical component is a
source file, plus header file for C/C++. Logical component is
representation of a constant, type, enumeration, method, etc. Module
represents C components in a language agnostic way. This makes possible to
generate wrappers for high level languages like C#, Java, Python, etc.
