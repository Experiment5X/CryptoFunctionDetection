Groups full features resolved for language: C.

Summary of language
===================

This summary shows the hierarchy of elements you can use, with the
required and optional attributes for each element.  The XML entity and
attribute names are case-sensitive and we use only lower-case names.

    <c_features name source path>
       <c_feature [uid] [full_uid] [name] [default]>
          <c_require [feature]>
             <c_alternative [feature]/>
          </c_require>
       </c_feature>
    </c_features>

Detailed specifications
=======================

All child entities are optional and can occur zero or more times without
any specific limits unless otherwise specified.  The same tag may occur
at different levels with different meanings, and in such cases will be
detailed more than once here.
